    today i fleshed out saving pixel_data into the database, we have a 2d list list of strings saved to the database. From there i implemented a get all art, based on the selected size on the front end. the working one right now is 16x16 any other display cuts it and frams it as if it was 16x unlimited which ill get to imlpementing later. but we have a way to save and store the color data and re render it back on the front end, with any color style hex,rgba,hsla etc.
